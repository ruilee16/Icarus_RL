# Project Description

Icarus is a simulation platform that combines state-of-the-art mesoscale travel simulations and fine-scale microclimate 
data to create a comprehensive modeling tool for urban dwellers' heat exposure assessment.

Icarus has been used in estimating urban residents' travel and activity heat exposure <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920922003741"> (Li et al., 2023a)</a>
and heat mitigation benefits for travelers when change the build environment and people's travel behaviour <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frsc.2023.1129388/full"> (Li et al., 2023b)</a>.

## Features

- Integration of mesoscale travel simulations and fine-scale microclimate data.
- Incorporated Agent-based modeling (ABM) of travel behavior and activity patterns (module 2).
- Incorporation of temperature data, parcel characteristics, household characteristics, and travel characteristics.
- Scenario analysis and evaluation of urban design strategies.
- Visualization and analysis of simulation results.
