# Project Description

Icarus is a simulation platform that combines state-of-the-art mesoscale travel simulations and fine-scale microclimate data to create a comprehensive modeling tool for urban environments.

## Features

- Integration of mesoscale travel simulations and fine-scale microclimate data.
- Incorporated Agent-based modeling (ABM) of travel behavior and activity patterns (module 2).
- Incorporation of temperature data, parcel characteristics, household characteristics, and travel characteristics.
- Scenario analysis and evaluation of urban design strategies.
- Visualization and analysis of simulation results.

## Getting Started
